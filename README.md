Rules:
- The player and computer are dealt five cards each and a card is turned over from the remainer of the pack and placed in the card-in-play pile.
- The next player must play a card on the card-in-play that is higher in rank, and scores the difference in points (a four played on a two will get two points).
- If the player's card is the same suit the score is doubled.
- If the player can only play a card lower in rank, the difference is subtracted from their score (unless it is the same suit, in which case no points are deducted).

Features and patch notes:
- Javafx and sound
- Exploring data structures
- Simple game theory
